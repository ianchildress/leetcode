https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward and forward. When palindromes are the length of a sentence, they ignore capitalization, punctuation, and word boundaries.

For example: racecar, 1001, 11/11/11, or 11:11.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:

Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

Example 4:

Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"



Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 1000
    s consist of only digits and English letters.
